          to do on my PC these days is run MAME and run SETI. It just occurred 
          to me to combine the two and create a SETI user group called MAME. For 
          those who run MAME and SETI... please feel free to join my <a href="http://setiathome.berkeley.edu/fcgi-bin/fcgi?cmd=team_lookup&name=MAME" target="_blank">group</a> 
          which I have very cunningly called MAME. For those who don't know... 
          <a href="http://www.mame.net/" target="_blank">MAME</a> is an acronym 
          for Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator. Through the gift of emulation 
          it loads binary data (pinched from arcade cabinets / ROMs) into the 
          emulator allowing you to play the exact game code of arcade games old 
          and new on your PC or other supported platforms. Sounds good? Yes it 
          is. <a href="http://setiathome.ssl.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">SETI</a> 
          is an acronym for the Search for Extra Terrestrial Intelligence. There 
          must be intelligence somewhere in the universe : ) Through a piece of 
          software available at the SETI website you can participate in crunching 
          radio telescope data which is received in the form of a work unit and 
          returned to the server when your PC has finished analysis. This is currently 
          the biggest mass distributed data analysing project in the world and 
          has led the way to similarly based projects such as cancer research. 
          Why spend large amounts of money on huge computers to solve problems 
          when all the processing power you need is already out there? The regular 
          SETI download comes in the form of a GUI program / screensaver...</font></div>

          all well and good but sometime ago I discovered that the CLI (command 
          line interface) version of SETI runs averagely 10 to 30% faster than 
          the GUI version. Generating graphics takes up CPU cycles and is unnecessary 
          even if you have the GUI version minimised to the system tray. The client 
          version looks something like this...</font></div>

        <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">In conjunction 
          with the CLI version of SETI, I also use two addons called <a href="http://personalwebs.myriad.net/roelof/setispy/" target="_blank">SETISpy</a> 
          and <a href="http://www.wakeassoc.com/setidriver/" target="_blank">SETIDriver</a>. 
          These are available via the AddOns page at the SETI website. SETISpy 
          is a good program. It allows you to see a whole host of information 
          including where in visible space your current work unit originated and 
          user / team statistics...</font></div>

          is a work unit caching program. The GUI and CLI version work on the 
          basis of downloading a work unit, processing, returning the result and 
          then downloading another work unit. This is OK if you are always connected 
          to the internet but those of us who are on fractional dial up or wish 
          to ensure that our PC is crunching 24/7 are wise to use a work unit 
          caching program. I use SETIDriver...</font></div>

        <div align="center"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So basically 
          I use the SETI CLI, SETIDriver and SETISpy. Details of how to get Spy 
          and Driver working together are in the FAQ on the SETISpy website. Through 
          good setup the only evidence of seeing these programs running is two 
          icons in the system tray. All three programs are controlled by the execution 
          / termination of SETISpy. I run SETISpy which in turn runs SETIDriver 
          which in turn controls the SETI CLI. Simple but effective.</font></div>
