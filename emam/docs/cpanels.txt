Back from the dead. I've decided to continue with the control panel packs after a 1+ year hiatus,
mainly because of the great flood of images I've recently gotten thanks to oNyX and Marshall. I 
don't have time to keep coming out with packs very often at all, but I found some time and got 
this together, and I will continue to release new packs periodically (I hope). The new max width
is 750 pixels, with the exception of a small handfull of images which have instruction 
strips/instruction gfx, those had to be 1000 pixels wide or else you wouldn't be able to read the 
text. Examples are a handful of NeoGeo panels and sf2ce.png. If there was a (large image size) panel 
pic with text that couldn't be read at 1000 wide, it was sized down to 750. I still haven't bored
you yet? Great, keep reading :P

Well, I'm sure some people won't be happy about having to download all the packs again, sorry. But
there's nothing I can do about it, all the files changed (every one). When I released the packs 
a year ago, I didn't know about png compression (oops), and in that time, names have changed, lots 
of images have been added and updated, I didn't black out the images before, etc. Besides, I worked 
my ass off on this, so don't bitch :P

Thanks again to Ciro for supporting these in EmuLoader:

Thanks to Fabio for adding support to MAMEFE for them:

Thanks to the main contributors oNyX, Marshall, and DJ Rosen for taking and/or supplying pics, and 
to everybody else who took the pics (too many sources to name and I don't even know them all, sorry). 

Thanks to Eldio for hosting these packs and making dats for ClrMAME and Rom Center. Also thanks in 
advance to any other frontend authors that add support for them in the future.

Quick & Simple Instructions:
These packs work the same way the others (cabinets, flyers, etc.) do. Unzip all the packs into a folder 
named "cpanels" and put it inside your MAME folder, you can also combine all the .png files into 
"cpanels.zip", and place it inside the "cpanels" folder. 

Notes:
There is support already for these packs in EmuLoader, and hopefully in other frontends and MAME32 in 
the future. 99.9% of these pics were created from pictures given to me by oNyX, these packs certainly 
wouldn't have been possible without him.

These images are of varying quality/size. I kept all of them in their original size (how they were when 
I got them) to preserve maximum possible quality. However, if they were enormous (more than 650 pixels 
wide) then they were resized to have a maximum width of 650 pixels. I don't think there's any need for 
a larger size than that for frontend use. Smaller and/or less quality pics will be replaced via future 
packs as better ones become available. 

The backgrounds of these images are not blacked out (a small handful are but mostly not), I don't have 
time to do that, feel free to black them out yourself if it means that much to you ;-)) I recommend 
using the "Stretch" option in EmuLoader for best viewing.
