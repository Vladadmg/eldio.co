HISTORY...
----------------------------------------
In Jan 01 I took over the maintenance of
the marquee packs for MAME. At that time
there were a total of 476 images using a
depth of 256 colours. They were also 350
pixels wide only. It was not long before
it was decided that 500 pixels and 16bit
colour depth would be needed. That's the
current standard. The vast bulk of these
marquee images have been saved from Ebay
which then have passed through my insane
APS squaring & PSP brushing process. The
majority of the NeoGeo / MVS insert raws
are thanks to oNyX and his contacts such
as Donnie. I would like to thank oNyX as
he has always been a huge help since the
humble beginnings. Of course, there have
been many other people who have provided
submitions or have been of help over the
years with things. A big saluted thanks!
In the past two years I would say I have
spent at least 1000 hrs on these marquee
images. So you better fekking enjoy ! :] 
----------------------------------------
PRESENT...
----------------------------------------
There seems to be a continuous influx of
new or better marquee images that can be
used for the packs. So there doesnt seem
to be end in sight at the present moment
----------------------------------------
FUTURE...
----------------------------------------
I am keeping an archive of marquees that
are in their original size and have been
brushed up and restored. They are in PNG
format and not subject to the horrors of
JPEG compression. If the future requires
images of a larger proportion then youll
be pleased to know that I probably won't
have a fekking 56K modem at that time :]
----------------------------------------
WHERE ON THE WEB...
----------------------------------------
These marquee images are used in various
places across the web from small project
web sites to large information databases
